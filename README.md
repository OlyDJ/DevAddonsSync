# Dev Addons Synchronizer

Synchronize your installed add-ons with a single click or by pressing OSKey+U.

DevAddonsSync helps you with the tedious task of testing every change you make to your extensions' source code, either by editing the installed add-ons directly, or with the source code in any other location (local or network).

Select the add-on you want to be "Default" from the list, edit the source code (with Text Editor or any other program) and press OSKey+U in View3D. The add-on is automatically installed, and a ZIP file is created ready for sharing (if "Create ZIP file" is enabled).

## Features:

## Why I created DAS?
For Blender Add-ons developers, the task to test each code change is kind of tedious. After saving modified files, the folder must be compressed to a ZIP file, and then reinstalled in Blender. While now (Blender 4.2) we can drag and drop the zip into Blender directly, for a developer it is a waste of time. Developers tend to create scripts to automate that process, but DevAddonsSync will speed up your workflow like never before.
Enjoy it!!!
